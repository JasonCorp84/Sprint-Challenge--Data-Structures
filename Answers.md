1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?

**Stack** 
Last In First Out - LIFO -. push() to add, pop() to remove. 

**Queue**

First In First Out - FIFO - push to add, shift() to remove.

2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?
  **Linked List**
  O(n);
  **Hash Table**
  O(1);
  **Binary Search Trees**
  O(log(n));

3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

Searching data in a hash table is O(1) vs O(n). The hash function will return of the location of any data in 1 step, while to find data in an array might takes as many steps as long the array is (considering worst case scenario).
